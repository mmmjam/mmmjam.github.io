# Workshops: What are they? 

We want to make sure that all of our participants have a successful experience in the Massachusetts Math Modeling Jam. To do so, we will run workshops on the week leading up to the competition that cover some of the basic skills used during a math modeling competition. 

These workshops are not mandatory--or even necessary--to have fun and do well, but they provide important skills that can help during the competition and future STEM endeavors. We hope you’ll be able to make it, and recommend that you attend at least a couple. <b>Note that your workshop attendance has no impact on your team's standing or final judging during the jam.<b>

# Math Modeling 101
## April 19, 2021
### Prerequisites: None 

To begin the week, we will cover the basics of Math Modeling: what is it, why is it useful, and more. We will also cover an example problem to show how to think through the problem and formulate a solution.

# Python
## April 20, 2021
### Prerequisites: [Download Python and Pycharm](https://mmmjam.github.io/installation/) 

Python is a very useful programming skill that aids in data management, automation, and more. Using Python and your computer to your advantage can save lots of time, especially when doing lots of small calculations. In this workshop, we will cover the basics of Python so you will be able to create your own programs.

# LaTeX & Scientific/Technical Writing
## April 21, 2021
### Prerequisites: [Create an Overleaf account](https://mmmjam.github.io/installation/) 

Understanding simple LaTeX and technical writing can help format your paper in a way that is professional and understandable. Without clear communication, the most important parts of your paper can get lost in translation. This workshop will cover what LaTeX is, some basic commands, and demonstrate how to use those commands in Overleaf, a free platform which hosts LaTeX.

# Excel
## April 22, 2021
### Prerequisites: Download Excel

Excel is a common software that seems basic at the surface level, but actually has lots of functionaliy that helps with data and statistic analysis. In this workshop, we will cover how to use a lot of important Excel features, especially those used to deal with a lot of data. Although a lot of people may have used Excel before, we will cover a lot of uncommon aspects of the software.

# Team Skills and Collaboration 
## April 23, 2021 
### Prerequisites: None 

 Possibly the hardest, and the most important aspect of any group work is understanding how to work in a team. This will not only be an extremely useful skill during MMMJam, but also throughout high school and beyond. In this workshop, our team will cover what works and what doesn’t in teamwork, as well as useful tips in organization, time management, and the soft skills that come with being on a math modeling team.

 During the MMMJam on Saturday, April 24th, we’ll be hosting our final workshop on math modeling! This will cover all of the basics you need to know in order to complete a math modeling problem, everything from asking questions about a real world problem to applying data to solve it. We’re really excited to bring you this workshop, and can’t wait to have fun with you in the event!
