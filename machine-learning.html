              	<h5>What is Machine Learning?</h5>

                <p>
                Machine Learning is a field of computer science that teaches computers how to make decisions and 
                predictions. Data scientists and computer programmers essentially feed machines data and use code 
                to teach them new patterns and analyses.
                </p>
            	
 
              	<h5>Why should I be excited about Machine Learning?</h5>

                <p>
                Machine learning (ML) is everywhere– from a roomba learning the most efficient routes to clean a 
                room to amazon echo or alexa answering your questions to self-driving cars that can navigate the 
                road safely. You can even use machine learning to understand what a cat is trying to say to you! 
                But how does machine learning work in the first place?
                </p>

                <p>
                The magic behind machine learning is a lot of data. We give data to the computer so it can learn 
                new patterns to build a machine learning (ML) model. This process is called training. Then, we give 
                data the computer hasn’t seen before and feed it through our ML model, to see if it performs the way 
                we expect it to. This process is called testing.
                </p>

                <p>
                For example, let’s say we want the computer to understand the difference between dogs and cats. 
                To us, this may seem like an easy task. However, to the computer, an image of a cat means a lot 
                of numbers - to be specific, 120x120x3 for a RBG (color) image that is 120 pixels wide by 120 pixels 
                high. We need to build a machine learning model and train the computer to understand these images. 
                So, we give the computer a lot of images of dogs and cats with labels so it can detect patterns and 
                learn to distinguish the two. After the training phase, we are now ready for the testing phase. 
                We give the computer an image of a cat it hasn’t seen before - and see if it can detect whether it is a 
                cat or a dog. Thanks to advances in computer processors over the past decade, computers can now store 
                and process hundreds of thousands of data points, allowing us to have strong machine learning models.
                </p>

                <p>
                There are many fields of machine learning - among these include natural language processing, 
                reinforcement learning, and image classification. The focus of this workshop is on image 
                classification- a type of machine learning that teaches robots what an image means in real life. 
                For your math modeling problem, you will be asked to build a machine learning model that can solve 
                the task of image classification.
                </p>


                <h5>What do machine learning scientists do?</h5>

                <p>
                Machine learning scientists work on solving problems that improve human lives. They program neural 
                networks and build machine learning models to solve such problems. For example, machine learning 
                scientists apply image classification to X-rays to identify whether someone could have Lung cancer 
                or not. This makes it a lot easier and quicker to form a life-saving diagnosis.
                </p>

                <p>
                Machine learning scientists have also made facial recognition possible! From using your face to 
                unlock your iPhone to catching criminals and tracking hundreds of passengers at airport security, 
                facial recognition is integral to protecting privacy and maintaining security.
                </p>

                <p>
                Machine learning scientists are also developing algorithms to help turn self-driving cars into 
                a reality. Autonomous vehicles rely on ML algorithms to learn how to avoid obstacles, safely 
                navigate busy roads, and protect their passengers from harm.
                </p>

                <p>
                Affectiva, a company based in Boston, is already using image classification in real life. 
                Affectiva develops Convolutional Neural Networks or CNNs to recognize faces and facial expressions 
                and ensure the safety of the driver or passengers in taxi services such as Uber or Lyft.
                </p>

                <p>
                Affectiva uses image classification to recognize a driver’s emotions. For example, if a driver 
                on the road looks tired or sleepy, Affectiva can alert the driver to stay awake so that they can 
                stay safe. This same program can understand when a customer is satisfied or upset with their taxi 
                service, based on their expressions. And finally, the most important way the company is using image 
                classification is to determine whether the traveler is actually safe inside the car. If the passenger 
                looks scared, then Affectiva could alert police to follow the car to ensure the safety of the passenger.
                </p>

                <p>
                Machine learning scientists at Disney’s animation studios use image classification to improve their 
                digital characters! By running programs that detect different faces and emotions, Disney animators 
                can check how realistic their characters are and make sure that everyone keeps their face in the 
                middle of action scenes or other dynamic movements. Here you can see an example of what that looks 
                like. The green squares around each character indicate that a program has detected a face at that 
                given location! This information can help animators detect what exactly shows up on-screen.
                </p>

                <p>
                Finally, ML Scientists at Uber ATG, a branch of Uber dedicated to autonomous vehicles, is using image 
                classification in self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are cars that are able to drive on the road by 
                themselves without help from a driver. With image classification, self-driving cars can see other 
                moving cars and pedestrians around them so they can navigate roads safely. Self-driving cars also 
                use image classification to detect road signs and the color of the traffic signals so they know when 
                to drive, slow down, or stop. This can tell drivers how to drive safely, where to turn, and what parts 
                of the road to avoid.
                </p>

                <p>
                All of this is possible because ML scientists also collect and sort through a lot of data. You need 
                thousands of ML Scientists to create reliable data, sift through it, label each data point, and make 
                sure it doesn’t have any biases (ie. that the dataset covers all possible cases) in order to have 
                strong machine learning models.
                </p>

                <h5>How does math modeling apply to machine learning?</h5>

                <p>
                Machine learning, at its core, is just math modeling! The different layers, functions, and datasets 
                used to train a neural network create an equation a computer can use to analyze different inputs, 
                or in our case, turn images into arrays of numbers into labels. 
                </p>

                <p>
                Think of it like this: while mathematicians create models to clarify parts of how the world work, 
                machine learning and neural networks are trained to find hidden patterns in the world to be just as, 
                if not more accurate than, the human brain. 
                </p>

                <p>
                So after several rounds of training, testing, and validation, the final neural network is nothing 
                more than a function--a mathematical process where an input transforms into an output. Each layer 
                adds another statistic or probability that gets translated into code for the neural network to 
                understand and learn from. And as programmers, we get to choose which mathematical techniques to 
                use when creating our model.
                </p>
