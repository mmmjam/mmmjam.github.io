              	<p>On <code class="highlighter-rouge">Monday, June 7th,</code> we'll delve into Ecology and its impact on the real 
                world! We'll be taking a math based approach (believe it or not, math is a huge and important part of 
                the field) to answer a real world problem. Then, you'll try to answer one on your own. Can't wait to 
                see you there!</p>
              	
              	<h5>What is ecology?</h5>

                <p>
                Simply put, <strong>ecology</strong> is a science which explores the interaction of living things, 
                including humans, and their environment. It’s reach can expand from park rangers to 
                research scientists, to even outer space! Ecology provides us with an understanding 
                of how <strong>species</strong> live together in balance, and how we can ensure their <strong>preservation</strong>.
                </p>
            	
 
              	<h5>Why should I be excited about ecology?</h5>

                <p>Chances are, you’ve been directly affected by ecology in several ways. Heard of <strong>climate
                change</strong>? Scientists were able to corroborate the effects of climate change by looking at 
                how animals and insect <strong>populations</strong> were affected by it. Hiked anywhere? Ecologists are 
                directly responsible for the <strong>conservation</strong> of forests and parks. In fact, you have ecology 
                to thank for most nature conservation. What about technology? <strong>Biomimicry</strong> is a technique 
                focused on modeling technology after nature, an offshoot of ecology. For example, many 
                current energy efficient building designs are based on termite towers. You can thank seed 
                burrs for the development of velcro. The most popular example, though, is how aircrafts and 
                jets were based off of bird wing <strong>aerodynamics</strong>. Ecologists help solve real world problems, 
                and directly help people and living <strong>organisms</strong>.</p>

                <p>Aside from its importance, ecology is fun! You can find careers in almost every 
                work setting, whether it be working on data analysis on a computer, conducting <strong>research</strong> 
                out in the field, or experimenting in the <strong>laboratory</strong>.</p>

                <h5>What do ecologists do?</h5>

                <p>
                Ecologists study the relationships between different organisms and their environments. 
                For example, how does a certain species of beaver affect the deer population in the same 
                <strong>ecosystem</strong>? How does the river they depend on affect both populations? 
                Where does climate change and chemical <strong>pollution</strong> come into play? What about the plants, 
                the weather, and the landscaping? How do humans exist within the ecosystem? Ecologists 
                strive to answer questions like these through <strong>observational studies</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                But ecology isn’t only limited to observation. Ecologists also develop <strong>models</strong> and 
                <strong>simulations</strong> to predict how different factors play into the environment. For example, 
                recent research in ecology is focused on predicting human population growth versus how 
                many people the Earth can sustain in the future. And then, ecologists play an integral 
                role in developing biomimicry tech and research. And, ecologists are the backbone of most 
                environment friendly advocacy and government policy.
                </p>

                <h5>What is ecology?</h5>

                <p>
                Ecologists use math modeling in their everyday work. For example, a huge part of ecology 
                is making predictions about the future of an ecosystem when something in it is changed. 
                This factor could be anything -- a predator removed, a chemical spill, limited food, or 
                even just time. The challenge in knowing how changes in the ecosystem affect the 
                environment, <strong>habitats</strong>, and species that depend on it. That’s where math modeling comes into 
                play. Ecologists use models like <strong>energy pyramids</strong>, <strong>food webs</strong>, 
                and <strong>biomagnification</strong> to explain 
                changes they see in ecosystems. They use mathematical formulas to be able to predict these 
                changes more precisely.
