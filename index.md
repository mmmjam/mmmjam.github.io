Along with the math modeling jam, we’ll also be holding several workshops and info sessions on a variety of topics on April 19-25! We’ll be working on everything from LaTeX to math modeling, and talking about everything from robotics to poetry. Feel free to stop by when you need something to do! <br><br>
We'll also be posting all of our resources on our YouTube link [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ge6-bfAyjfRiXGL7no1vw).
