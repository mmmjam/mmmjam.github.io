overview: Possibly the hardest, and the most important aspect of any group work is understanding how to work in a team. This will not only be an extremely useful skill during MMMJam, but also throughout high school and beyond. In this workshop, our team will cover what works and what doesn't in teamwork, as well as useful tips in organization, time management, and the soft skills that come with being on a math modeling team.
