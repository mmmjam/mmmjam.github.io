# Info Sessions: What's happening after we submit? 

Although you'll stop working on your math modeling papers by 10AM on April 25th, the fun doesn't stop there! From then until our Awards Ceremony at 6:30 PM, we will be hosting info sessions about the schools hosting this event: WPI and the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science! This is a great opportunity to meet the people behind M<sup>3</sup>J, get some tips about college, and gain more exposure to STEM.

While these info sessions are not mandatory nor necessary, we hope you come to at least one! Please see below for a quick summary about each info session. All info sessions will be recorded and later made publicly available if you cannot attend. 

<b>Note that your info session attendance has no impact on your team's standing or final judging during the jam.<b>
