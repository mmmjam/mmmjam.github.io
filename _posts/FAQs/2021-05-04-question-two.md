answer: We want to make sure that all of our participants have a successful experience in the Massachusetts Math Modeling Jam. To do so, we will run workshops on the week leading up to the competition that cover some of the basic skills used during a math modeling competition.
answer-2: These workshops are not mandatory - or even necessary - to have fun and do well, but they provide important skills that can help during the competition and future STEM endeavors. We hope you'll be able to make it, and recommend that you attend at least a couple. Note that your workshop attendance has no impact on your team's standing or final judging during the jam.
