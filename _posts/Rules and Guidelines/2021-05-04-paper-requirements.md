<p>Submitting a paper is a required component of the 2021 math jam.
</p>
<h5>Submission Eligibility & Deadlines</h5>
<p>Submitting a paper is required to qualify for awards. No submissions will be accepted nor eligible for judging after April 25, 10 AM EDT. Please contact an event runner if there are extraordinary circumstances.
</p>
<h5>Page Limits</h5>
<p>Excluding references and citations, Junior Division papers must be no longer than five (5) pages and Senior Division papers must be no longer than seven (7) pages. This means that the last page of content can be no later than Page 5 or Page 7 respectively. Judges will not consider any pages past this cut-off for awards. Note that this doesn't mean you need to write 5 or 7 pages of paper -- make sure that your paper addresses all components of your model while being as concise as possible.
</p>
<h5>Standard Formatting</h5>
<p>Final papers must use the Times New Roman, size 12 font in text that is not headings, titles, or other forms of formatting. Teams are welcome to choose how to organize the sections of their paper and whether to include color.
