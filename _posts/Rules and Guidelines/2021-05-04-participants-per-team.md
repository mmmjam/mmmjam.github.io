<p>M<sup>3</sup>J is a collaborative event! Doing a modeling project is much easier with a group, especially on a time limit. When one teammate is analyzing data, another might be drafting the report while a third is testing different equations! For this reason, each competing team must have 3-4 members. All modelers must be based in Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>As a participant, you can sign up for the math jam with your team using our registration form <a href="http://wpi.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4JBDYhsAq8jDWzI">here</a>!
</p>
<p>If you do not have a team before signing up, that is ok! Specify this on the registration form. Our event coordinators will get back to you with a randomly-generated team of members from your division with different skill sets.
