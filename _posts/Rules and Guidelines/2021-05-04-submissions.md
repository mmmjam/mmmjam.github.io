<p>Each team is expected to submit a final math modeling paper and can also submit an optional elevator pitch to win a raffle.
</p>
<p>All interested teams will have their submissions showcased on our gallery! The gallery is a great way to celebrate your own work and see what your fellow math modelers worked on during the jam.
</p>
