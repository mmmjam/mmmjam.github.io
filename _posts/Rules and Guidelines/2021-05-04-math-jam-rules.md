#### Paper Requirements
Submitting a paper is a required component of the 2021 math jam. Submitting a paper is required to qualify for awards. No submissions will be accepted nor eligible for judging after April 25, 10 AM EDT. Please contact an event runner if there are extraordinary circumstances.

Excluding references and citations, Junior Division papers must be no longer than five (5) pages and Senior Division papers must be no longer than seven (7) pages. This means that the last page of content can be no later than Page 5 or Page 7 respectively. Judges will not consider any pages past this cut-off for awards. Note that this doesn't mean you need to write 5 or 7 pages of paper -- make sure that your paper addresses all components of your model while being as concise as possible.

Final papers must use the Times New Roman, size 12 font in text that is not headings, titles, or other forms of formatting. Teams are welcome to choose how to organize the sections of their paper and whether to include color.

#### Elevator Pitch
Submitting an elevator pitch is an optional component of the 2021 math jam for a team. However, anyone who submit a speech will automatically be eligible in the raffle for a gift card!
Each team is welcome to submit a video or audio to present their project in a verbal form. This is a fun and great opportunity to practice public speaking skills and build a community in our virtual landscape!

Please keep the following in mind:
