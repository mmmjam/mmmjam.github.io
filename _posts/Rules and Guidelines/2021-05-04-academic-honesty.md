<p>Academic honesty is the principle of being honest in all the work you do. In the context of M<sup>3</sup>J, an academically honest team creates their own model and reports it without cheating or presenting the work of others as their own.</p>
<p>If academic dishonesty is detected, teams will be given a 2-hour window to correct their mistake. Otherwise, the M3J Team will disqualify the paper to ensure a fair playing field for everyone.
</p>
<p>Research is encouraged and an important part of making a good model. If you ever quote, paraphrase, use an image or graph that you did not make, or reference facts that you found while researching, you MUST cite your sources. You cannot take credit for work that is not yours. For example, below is a acceptable citation for this webpage that was generated through <a href="https://www.easybib.com/">Easybib</a>:
</p>
<p><em>Team, MMMJ. "MMMJ Website." M<sup>3</sup>J, 1 Jan. 2021, mmmjam.github.io/. 
</em></p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://mmmjam.github.io/resources/#sample-paper">sample paper</a> for an example of acceptable work.
</p>
<p>Don't know how to cite your research? ASK! M<sup>3</sup>J's Discord is a great place to get quick help from event runners and your math modeling community.
