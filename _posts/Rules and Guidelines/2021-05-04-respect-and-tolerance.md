<p>The Massachusetts Math Modeling Jam is committed to providing a safe and positive environment for everyone, regardless of virtual barriers. Every participant, mentor, volunteer, judge, organizer, and other M<sup>3</sup>J associate is required to be RESPECTFUL & MATURE.
</p>
<p>Be RESPECTFUL to every math modeler. Even if you have never met your teammates or fellow participants, always abide by the golden rule: treat others how you want to be treated. If you think your actions or words even have the potential to make someone uncomfortable, do not do it.
</p>
<p>Be MATURE to speakers and M<sup>3</sup>J staff. The event runners, judges, and most of our speakers are students-just like you! In any group-wide Zoom meetings, workshops, or info sessions you attend, please help us make the event run smoothly for everyone.
</p>
<p>Please note that every member of the M<sup>3</sup>J team covers multiple duties, so it may take time for us to respond to your questions during the event.
