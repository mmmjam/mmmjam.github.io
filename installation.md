## Good News Is, You Don't Need Any Prior STEM Knowledge for the MMMJam!
Our team's working on getting helpful tutorials and resources for math modeling and many other STEM topics you might be interested in. However, the event will be run on Zoom and Discord, so it will be helpful if you familiarize yourself to those two platforms. We'll update the sections below with more information in the coming weeks.

<br>When you register for MMMJam, we'll email you in a thread with your teammates with the schedule to the event, and how to access our discord server.

## Other Ways You Can Communicate

We'll update this section with more content soon. But keep in mind, Discord and Zoom don't have to be the only modes of communication for your team. Whether it be email or social media, there should be a viable platform for you and your teammates to work on. If you have any trouble, please email us at mmmjam.team@gmail.com.
