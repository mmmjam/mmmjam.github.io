<br><br><b>You do not need to know what any of these are to create the "best" solution at the jam!</b> This event will be fun for everyone, regardless of skill level. We’ll go over math modeling in the actual event, and host additional optional workshops the week before, if you’re interested in learning some of these things, though. We hope you can leave this event with new friends, skills, and memories.
