# General Rules


## Registration

Registration will open on March 10, 2021 and close on April 14, 2021. The forms will be taken down after this time and no later submissions will be considered for this year’s event. Additionally, no more than 30 teams will be admitted this year. We’ll only be considering 2 teams per school from March 10 to March 24. If we have any remaining spots open, we’ll open up the registration to anyone else who wants to register on March 24.
The team will assume that the information provided in the registration form is accurate; please do your best to avoid small mistakes! However, email any corrections to the registration to [mmmjam.team@gmail.com](mailto:mmmjam.team@gmail.com). 


## Participants Per Team

M<sup>3</sup>J is a collaborative event! Doing a modeling project is much easier with a group, especially on a time limit. When one teammate is analyzing data, another might be drafting the report while a third is testing different equations! For this reason, **each competing team must have 3-4 members**. All modelers must be based in Massachusetts.

As a participant, you can sign up for the math jam with your team using our registration form [here](http://wpi.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4JBDYhsAq8jDWzI). If you do not have a team before signing up, that is ok! Specify this on the registration form. Our event coordinators will get back to you with a randomly-generated team of members from your division with different skill sets. 

## Divisions

This event divides its participants into two divisions: the <b>Junior Division(Grades 5-7)</b> and <b>Senior Division(Grades 7-9)</b>. Seventh graders can join either division: either middle school (the Junior Division) or high school (the Senior Division).

## Submissions 

Each team is expected to submit a final math modeling paper and can also submit an optional elevator pitch to win a raffle.

All interested teams will have their submissions showcased on our gallery! The gallery is a great way to celebrate your own work and see what your fellow math modelers worked on during the jam.

Specifics about 2021 submission standards can be found [here](https://mmmjam.github.io/rules-and-guidelines/#2021-math-jam-rules), and additional resources to help with projects can be found [here](mmmjam.github.io/resources). 


## Time Limit

In total, each team will have <b>24 hours</b> to develop a math model and submit their final report. 

Problems for both divisions will be released [here](https://mmmjam.github.io/rules-2021/) at 10 AM EDT on April 24, 2021. Please re-load your page if you do not automatically see the problem, and contact the M<sup>3</sup>J team if you do not see it after 5 minutes. 

Submission forms to pass in a final report will be released [here](https://mmmjam.github.io/submission/) at 12 PM EDT on April 24, 2021. Please note **each team can only submit once**. Take the time to review your model before you submit. 

<b> The deadline to submit all papers is 10 AM EDT on April 25, 2021.</b> There will be a grace period until 10:30 AM EDT for any teams who face unexpected technical difficulties to submit their papers without penalty. 

## Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is the principle of being honest in all the work you do. In the context of M<sup>3</sup>J, an academically honest team creates their own model and reports it without cheating or presenting the work of others as their own.

If academic dishonesty is detected, teams will be given a 2-hour window to correct their mistake. Otherwise, the M<sup>3</sup>J Team will disqualify the paper to ensure a fair playing field for everyone. 

**Research is encouraged and an important part of making a good model**. If you ever quote, paraphrase, use an image or graph that you did not make, or reference facts that you found while researching, you MUST cite your sources. **For the MMMJam, you can just cite by leaving the website link or, if your resource is on paper, the title and author of the resource**. **You cannot take credit for work that is not yours**. For example, below is a acceptable citation for this webpage that was generated through [Easybib](https://www.easybib.com/):

<i>mmmjam.github.io/rules-and-guidelines</i>

<!-- <i>Team, MMMJ. “MMMJ Website .” M³J, 1 Jan. 2021, mmmjam.github.io/. </i> -->

Refer to the [sample paper](https://mmmjam.github.io/resources/#sample-paper) for an example of acceptable work. 

Don't know how to cite your research? ASK! M<sup>3</sup>J's Discord is a great place to get quick help from event runners and your math modeling community. 

## Respect & Tolerance

The Massachusetts Math Modeling Jam is committed to providing a safe and positive environment for everyone, regardless of virtual barriers. Every participant, mentor, volunteer, judge, organizer, and other M<sup>3</sup>J associate is required to be RESPECTFUL & MATURE.  

<b> Be RESPECTFUL to every math modeler. </b> Even if you have never met your teammates or fellow participants, always abide by the golden rule: treat others how you want to be treated. If you think your actions or words even have the potential to make someone uncomfortable, do not do it. 

<b> Be MATURE to speakers and M<sup>3</sup>J staff.</b> The event runners, judges, and most of our speakers are students--just like you! In any group-wide Zoom meetings, workshops, or info sessions you attend, please help us make the event run smoothly for everyone. 

Please note that every member of the M<sup>3</sup>J team covers multiple duties, so it may take time for us to respond to your questions during the event. 

# 2021 Math Jam Rules 

In addition to the general rules above, the 2021 math jam will follow these requirements for each team's work. 

## Paper Requirements 

Submitting a paper is a required component of the 2021 math jam. 


<b>Submission Eligibility & Deadlines:</b> Submitting a paper is required to qualify for awards. No submissions will be accepted nor eligible for judging after April 25, 10 AM EDT. Please contact an event runner if there are extraordinary circumstances. 

<b>Page Limits:</b> Excluding references and citations, Junior Division papers must be no longer than five (5) pages and Senior Division papers must be no longer than seven (7) pages. This means that the last page of content can be no later than Page 5 or Page 7 respectively. Judges will not consider any pages past this cut-off for awards. Note that this doesn’t mean you need to write 5 or 7 pages of paper-- make sure that your paper addresses all components of your model while being as concise as possible.

<b>Standard Formatting:</b> Final papers must use the Times New Roman, size 12 font in text that is not headings, titles, or other forms of formatting. Teams are welcome to choose how to organize the sections of their paper and whether to include color.


## Elevator Pitch

Submitting an elevator pitch is an optional component of the 2021 math jam for a team. However, anyone who submit a speech will automatically be eligible in the raffle for a gift card! 

Each team is welcome to submit a video or audio to present their project in a verbal form. This is a fun and great opportunity to practice  public speaking skills and build a community in our virtual landscape! 


<b>Submission Eligibility & Deadlines:</b> Submission Eligibility & Deadlines: Submitted videos will not be considered when judging for awards. Videos or recordings will be accepted until 11:59 PM EDT on April 25, and we will email you and update our website if your team wins the raffle.

<b>Uploading:</b> Please upload your final cut of your video/audio as a MP4/MP3 file respectively to our [submission page](https://mmmjam.github.io/submission/)! 

<b>Time Limit:</b> Please keep your submission under three (3) minutes.

<b>Content:</b> Please state your team number (and your names if you choose) within the first minute of your recording. This is especially helpful for event coordinators later when they organize work for the math jam gallery!
