# Jam Rules & Guidelines
{: .no_toc }

Each math jam will adhere to this Code of Conduct about event requirements, guidelines, and tips! It's a good idea to review this page <b> before </b> the problem is released. Please direct any questions you have to [the math jam team](mailto:mmmjam.team@gmail.com).

## Participants Per Team

MMMJ is a collaborative event! Writing a modeling report is not easy to do alone, especially on a time limit. When one teammmate is analyzing statistics in spreadsheets, another might be drafting the report while a third is testing different equations! For this reason, each competing team must have <b> 3-4 members who live in Massachusetts</b>. Ensure that each member is accreddited on your final submission. 

As a participant, you can sign up for the math jam with your team using [our registration form]("https://forms.gle/ekAnfLNfgoC297Mn9")! 

If you do not have a team while signing up, that is ok! Our registration form takes care of that. Specify what you are looking for in a teammate and our event coordinators will get back to you with a randomly-generated team that complements your skills and division. 

## Divisions

This event divides its participants into two divisions: the <b> Junior Division </b> and <b> Senior Division </b>. 

The Junior Divison includes math modellers from 5th to 8th grade. Math modellers from 8th to 10th grade fall under the Senior Division. This is to ensure equitable judging and an appropriate experience for each participant. 

<b> Eighth graders are the only competitors who can choose which division they want to compete in </b>. Each school district has a different cut-off date for when middle school ends and high school begins; hence, it would be unfair to group all eighth graders into either division. Whichever division that an eighth grader chooses must reflect their current educational stage: either middle school (the Junior Division) or high school (the Senior Divison). 

## Time Limit

In total, each team will have <b>24 hours</b> to develop a math model and submit their final report. 

Problems for both divisions will be released [here](https://mmmjam.github.io/rules-2021/) at 10 AM EST on April 24, 2021. Please re-load your page if you do not automatically see the problem, and contact the team if you do not see it after 5-10 minutes. 

Submission forms to pass in a final report will be released [here](https://mmmjam.github.io/submission/) at 12 PM EST on April 24, 2021. However, <b> we highly encourage teams to use the entire time as all submissions are final</b>. 

<b> The deadline to submit all papers is 10 AM EST on April 25, 2021.</b> It is highly encouraged to submit all reports BEFORE 10:00 AM, but there will be a grace period until 10:30 AM EST for any teams who face unexpected technical difficulties to submit their papers without penalty. 

## Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is the practice of being honest in all the work you do. In the context of MMMJ, an academically honest team creates their own modeling report without cheating or presenting the work of others as your own. 

Writing a math modeling paper means using resources on the Internet: government documents, various websites, graphs, videos, programming code, you name it! Research is encouraged and an important part of making a good model. If you ever quote, paraphrase, use an image or graph that you did not make, or reference facts that you found while researching, you MUST cite your sources. You cannot take credit for work that is not yours. [Easybib](https://www.easybib.com/) is a great citation generator. 

Judges will check each report to verify that credit has been given where it is due and that your paper is your own. The MMMJ Team reserves the right to disqualify a paper if plagiarism or academic dishonesty is detected to ensure a fair playing field. 

Don't know how to cite your research? ASK! MMMJ's Discord is a great place to get quick help from event runners and your math modeling community. 

## Respect & Tolerance

The Massachusetts Math Modeling Jam is committed to providing a safe and positive environment for everyone, regardless of virtual barriers. Every participant, mentor, volunteer, judge, organizer, and other MMJ associates are required to be RAD: respectful, aware, and diplomatic. 

<b> Always be RESPECTFUL to every math modeller. </b> Even if you have never met your teammates or fellow participants, always abide by the golden rule: treat others how you want to be treated. If you think your actions or words even have the potential to make someone uncomfortable, do not do it without their permission. The MMMJ Team has the ability to take action, if deemed appropriate, if a participant faces a harassment report. 

<b> Be AWARE of your actions and environment. </b> It's completely okay to have conflicts while approaching a new problem, but that does not give anyone the right to harass, offend, or target a fellow modeller. If you know of or are in a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, please report it IMMEDIATELY to an event runner or admin of the MMMJ team. The quickest way to reach us during the math jam is through Discord, but we will also regularly check Gmail. 

<b> Be DIPLOMATIC to event runners and MMJ staff.</b> The event runners, judges, and nearly every speaker are students--just like you! In any group-wide Zoom meetings, workshops, or info sessions you attend, please help us run the event smoothly by avoiding disruptive behavior. 

A member of the MMMJ team will always be online on Zoom, Discord, and Gmail during the jam. Though we will try to respond as soon as an issue arises, please allow us  time to respond to emails sent during the event.
