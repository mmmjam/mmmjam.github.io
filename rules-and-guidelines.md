# General Rules

## Participants Per Team

M<sup>3</sup>J is a collaborative event! Doing a modeling project is much easier with a group, especially on a time limit. When one teammmate is analyzing data, another might be drafting the report while a third is testing different equations! For this reason, each competing team must have <b> 3-4 members. All modelers must be based in Massachusetts.</b> 

As a participant, you can sign up for the math jam with your team using [our registration form](https://forms.gle/ekAnfLNfgoC297Mn9)! 

If you do not have a team before signing up, that is ok! Specify what you are looking for in a teammate on the registration form. Our event coordinators will get back to you with a randomly-generated team of  members from your division with different skillsets.  

## Divisions

This event divides its participants into two divisions: the <b> Junior Division(Grades 5-8)</b> and <b> Senior Division(Grades 8-10)</b>. 

<b> Eighth graders must join the division that aligns with their sending school </b>. Whichever division that an eighth grader chooses while registering must reflect the school they currently attend: either middle school (the Junior Division) or high school (the Senior Divison).

## Submissions 

Each team is expected to submit a final math modeling paper and an optional elevator pitch. 

All interested teams will have their submissions showcased on our gallery! The gallery is a great way to celebrate your own work and see what your fellow math modelers worked on during the jam. 

Specifics about 2021 submission standards can be found [here](https://mmmjam.github.io/rules-and-guidelines/#2021-math-jam-rules), and additional resources to help with projects can be found [here](mmmjam.github.io/resources). 


## Time Limit

In total, each team will have <b>24 hours</b> to develop a math model and submit their final report. 

Problems for both divisions will be released [here](https://mmmjam.github.io/rules-2021/) at 10 AM EST on April 24, 2021. Please re-load your page if you do not automatically see the problem, and contact the M<sup>3</sup>J team if you do not see it after 5 minutes. 

Submission forms to pass in a final report will be released [here](https://mmmjam.github.io/submission/) at 12 PM EST on April 24, 2021. Please note each team can only submit once. Take as much time as you need to form a model that you're proud of.  

<b> The deadline to submit all papers is 10 AM EST on April 25, 2021.</b> There will be a grace period until 10:30 AM EST for any teams who face unexpected technical difficulties to submit their papers without penalty. 

## Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is the principle of being honest in all the work you do. In the context of M<sup>3</sup>J, an academically honest team creates their own model and report without cheating or presenting the work of others as their own. 

Math models are based off real life. This means your team will likely use resources on the Internet: government documents, graphs, videos, programming code, you name it! Research is encouraged and an important part of making a good model. If you ever quote, paraphrase, use an image or graph that you did not make, or reference facts that you found while researching, you MUST cite your sources. You cannot take credit for work that is not yours. For example, below is a acceptable citation for this webpage that was generated through [Easybib](https://www.easybib.com/):

<i>Team, MMMJ. “MMMJ Website .” M³J, 1 Jan. 2021, mmmjam.github.io/. </i>


To ensure a fair playing field, The M<sup>3</sup>J Team reserves the right to disqualify a paper if academic dishonesty is detected. 

Don't know how to cite your research? ASK! M<sup>3</sup>J's Discord is a great place to get quick help from event runners and your math modeling community. 

## Respect & Tolerance

The Massachusetts Math Modeling Jam is committed to providing a safe and positive environment for everyone, regardless of virtual barriers. Every participant, mentor, volunteer, judge, organizer, and other M<sup>3</sup>J associate is required to be a RAM: respectful, aware, and mature. 

<b> Be RESPECTFUL to every math modeller. </b> Even if you have never met your teammates or fellow participants, always abide by the golden rule: treat others how you want to be treated. If you think your actions or words even have the potential to make someone uncomfortable, do not do it. The M<sup>3</sup>J Team reserves the right to take action against any inappropriate behavior.

<b> Be AWARE of yourself and your environment. </b> It's normal to have conflicts while approaching a new problem, but that does not make bullying, offending, or targeting a fellow modeler acceptable. If you know of or are in a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, please report it IMMEDIATELY to an event runner or admin of the M<sup>3</sup>J team. The quickest way to reach us during the math jam is through Discord, but we will also regularly check Gmail. 

<b> Be MATURE to speakers and MMJ staff.</b> The event runners, judges, and most of our speakers are students--just like you! In any group-wide Zoom meetings, workshops, or info sessions you attend, please help us make the event run smoothly for everyone. 

A member of the M<sup>3</sup>J team will always be online on Zoom, Discord, and Gmail during the jam. Please note that every member of the M<sup>3</sup>J team covers multiple duties, so it may take time for us to respond to your questions during the event. 

# 2021 Math Jam Rules 

In addition to the general rules above, the 2021 math jam will follow these requirements for each team's work. 

## Paper Requirements 

Submitting a paper is a required component of the 2021 math jam. 


<b>Submission Eligibility & Deadlines:</b> Submitting a paper is required to qualify for awards. No submissions will be accepted nor eligible for judging after April 25, 10 AM EST. S Please contact an event runner if there are extroidinary circumstances. 

<b>Page Limits:</b>Excluding references and citations, Junior Division papers must be no longer than five (5) pages and Senior Division papers must be no longer than seven (7) pages.

## Elevator Pitch

Submitting an elevator pitch is an optional component of the 2021 math jam for a team. However, teams who submit a team recording will be eligible for a raffle of mini-prizes. 

Each team is welcome to submit a video or audio to present their project in a verbal form. This is a fun and great opportunity to practice  public speaking skills and build a community in our virtual landscape!
