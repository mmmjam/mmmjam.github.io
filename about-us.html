<p><strong>Learn more about the team behind the Math Modeling Jam!<br></strong></p>

<p>MMMJam was created in 2021 by a group of high school seniors at the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at the Worcester Polytechnic 
Institute. Our hope was to open up math modeling to kids across Massachusetts and build an interest or appreciation for the applicability of
STEM and math in the real world. Stay tuned for more of our events, and please contact us with any questions!</p>
